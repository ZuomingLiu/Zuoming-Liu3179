    <h1>The temperatue change in the 20th Century</h1>
    <p class="description">The global changes in temperature, which have a significant impact on human life and the natural environment in all parts of the world, and the growing problem of global warming, which could lead to a range of problems such as rising sea levels and dwindling freshwater resources, Australia's major cities are almost always coastal cities, so we need to pay more attention to this issue.Colors are graded from blue to red, and the more red they are, the more the average temperature increases over the last century, and vice versa.</p >
    <div class="pure-g">
      <h2>This is the first section</h2>
      <div class='desc'>The first part shows the increase in the temperature of every country in January over the past century.</div>
      <div id='visualization'></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <h2>This is the second section</h2>
      <div class='desc'>The second part contains two line charts, the first of which represents the size of the temperature changes in Australia over the past century in every decade, and the second of which compares Melbourne with Brasilia</div>
      <div class='desc'>From this line chart, we can see that the average January temperature of the Australian states in the last century is relatively stable, and that the temperature differences between the states are basically based on differences in location and latitude.We can also select specific states for observation.</div>
      <div id='visualization2'></div>
      <div class='desc'>Melbourne Brasilia are cities in the southern hemisphere, Melbourne is the big international city in the developed world, and Brasilia is the capital of the developing world. In this picture, we can find that their temperature trends are basically the same, except that Brasilia is generally higher than Melbourne, and in combination with our first map, it can be concluded that in the southern hemisphere, the difference in temperature between developed and developing countries is not very obvious</div>
      <div id='visualization3'></div>
    </div>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <h2>This is the third section</h2>
      <div class='desc'>The third part is a Layered Plot with Dual-Axis, which means one x axis with two y axis, the x axis represents the year, left-y axis represents the change in tmperatue（the green one）, the right-y axis stands for the height of the Global sea level(the right one).As we can see from the figure, the global average temperature in the 20th century is rising, as well as the global sea level, which shows a positive relationship.</div>
